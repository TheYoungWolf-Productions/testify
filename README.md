# Testify

Self-assessment or Self-evaluation is defined as the wide variety of mechanisms and techniques through which students describe (i.e., assess) and possibly assign merit or worth (i.e., evaluate) to the qualities of their own learning/knowledge. 
We aim to shed light onto these mechanisms and techniques through an all-inclusive, easy to use Self-assessment System (i.e., framework) in the medical industry which enhances self-regulated learning (SRL) or at least the central components of it such as goal setting and monitoring, or metacognition.

In your project folder, run the following commands in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheYoungWolf-Productions/testify.git
cd testify
flutter pub get
```
`Note:` You need your [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) and [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows) already setup. I recommend using *VSCode* as the editor with __Flutter__ extension.
